# Font-Creator-Tool
The Font Creator Tool may help you make Custom Unity Fonts easily using .png image files.
This tool is still under development, however it does work in its current state.

# Issues
The FCT uses old depricated methods to create the fonts. I haven't figured out how to use the newer methods to acieve the same thing since the documentation sucks and I feel that the deprecated methods are way easier to use. Feel free to Clone and Update the code if you know how the newer methods work, please send me the update though.
